    <h2>Bring 1-on-1 training to large groups</h2>
    <p>
      Company training is often long documents and corny videos. Worse, if you
      have a question about anything, you'd have to wait until the end of a
      video or document, or re-read the whole thing to try and find the answer.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to ask questions as they come up, not wait.</li>
      <li>You want to be guided, not info-dumped.</li>
      <li>
        You want to learn your way, not based on the delivery style of the video
        or document
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cats with Bats</h2>
    <p>
      Cats with Bats solves that by giving the organizer a quick way to convert
      any existing documents into a teacher, and giving the students access to
      that teacher. This teacher adapts to the student's learning style and
      guides them step-by-step through a training course.
