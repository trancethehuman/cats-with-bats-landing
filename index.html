    <h2>Remove errors when reading guide docs & SOPs with AI</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      People following long guide docs and SOPs (<a
        href="https://blog.montrium.com/experts/what-are-sops-and-why-does-my-organization-need-them"
        >Standard Operating Procedures</a
      >) are bound to make mistakes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Sometimes they need to ask questions that can be answered right there in
      the doc.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Sometimes it feels like it's faster to just show them directly, 1-on-1.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>But that takes resources and time.</p>
    <br />
    <p>This goes for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Onboarding new employees</li>
      <li>Coding tutorials</li>
      <li>Machinery operation steps</li>
      <li>Security & compliance procedures</li>
      <li>Learning a new cooking recipe</li>
      <li>Homework assignments</li>
      <li>And more.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Some people just want to write their SOPs and guides once and move on;
      you're passionate about the experience of reading your work.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Why don't you give your employees / new hires / students the best SOP
      reading experience possible?
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Cats with Bats</h2>
    <p>
      Cats with Bats solves this by turning your training docs into
      micro-learning AI Guides that guide the reader step-by-step and answer
      their questions.
