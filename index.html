    <h2>Long, detailed documentation is a gold mine to learn new things.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>From "Getting Started" guide to new employee onboarding document.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      But if someone is slow at reading, it's difficult to read and avoid making
      mistakes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      It's also cognitively taxing to find information quickly (imagine a
      25-page document).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The biggest issue with docs is how often people come to others with
      questions that can be answered by reading the document.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Learning something new can be overwhelming.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>But not when you're being guided.</p>
    <br />
    <p>From long coding tutorials to onboard documents and SOPs.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Replace them with step-by-step, guided learning, and instant Q&A.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Cats with Bats</h2>
    <p>
      Cats with Bats solves this by turning a guide document into micro-learning
      AI Agents that can guide the reader step-by-step and answer questions
      instantly.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Don't just write guides. Teach, with AI.</p>
