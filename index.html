    <h2>Bring 1-on-1 training to large groups</h2>
    <p>
      Company training is often long documents and corny videos. If I have a
      question about the training, I'd have to wait until the end, or re-read
      the whole thing to get it. It's 2023 and I don't want that.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I want to ask my questions as they come up, not wait.</li>
      <li>I want to be guided, not info-dumped.</li>
      <li>I want to learn my way, not either document or video</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cats with Bats</h2>
    <p>
      Cats with Bats solves that by giving the organizer a quick way to convert
      any existing documents into a teacher, and giving me the teacher.
