    <p>Create AI-enabled team training & workshop just by writing docs.</p>

    <h2>Bring 1-on-1 training to large groups</h2>
    <p>
      What's the best thing about having a human training another? Learner can
      ask questions, teacher can set the pace and quiz to solidify learnings.
    </p>
    <p>But that takes resources and time.</p>
    <p>Same goes for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Onboarding new employees</li>
      <li>Showing software engineers how to use a new library</li>
      <li>Training technicians on how to operate a new machine</li>
      <li>Training security & compliance</li>
      <li>Learning a new cooking recipe</li>
      <li>University / college / high school homework assignments</li>
      <li>And more.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      You might spend weeks or months building a training program using
      complicated instructional design software, making slides and creating
      interactive activities.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Or you can just write a "magical" document.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Cats with Bats</h2>
    <p>
      Cats with Bats solves this by turning your training docs into
      micro-learning AI coaches that guide the learner step-by-step and answer
      their questions.
