    <h2>Long, detailed documentation is a gold mine.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>But it's hard to read and find useful information quickly.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      When following a long document from top to bottom (for example, a
      <a
        href="https://blog.montrium.com/experts/what-are-sops-and-why-does-my-organization-need-them"
        >Standard Operating Procedures</a
      >), people make mistakes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Also, often people come to others with questions that can be answered by
      reading the document?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Often, it's faster to just show people directly, 1-on-1.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But that takes resources and time out of your day.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Learning something new is overwhelming.</h2>
    <br />
    <p>From long coding tutorials to onboard documents and SOPs.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Replace them with step-by-step, guided learning, and instant Q&A.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Cats with Bats</h2>
    <p>
      Cats with Bats solves this by turning your internal training docs or
      external user guides into micro-learning AI Agents that can guide the
      reader step-by-step and answer their questions on the fly for quick
      referencing.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Make sure whoever your audience is gets the most out of your documentation
      and actually understand them.
